= Userscripts collection

include::../_navhome.adoc[]

These are a collection of userscripts that you can use with Tampermonkey and
(probably) Violentmonkey.  All of these are fairly trivial, so should be MIT
unless specified otherwise (see the source file itself for copyright
information).

https://github.com/kandiyohi/LinkedInDeAnnoyance[LinkedIn deannoyance]:: for
mobile firefox automatically clicks the annoying banner on the LinkedIn mobile
site that tries to get you to install the mobile app.  Tested on Mobile, and
made using Firefox desktop's responsive design mode, though I believe it has
stopped working.

https://github.com/kandiyohi/YoutubeFlipVideo[Youtube Flip Video]:: adds a
button to flip a Youtube video. This was made to follow along with dance videos
so that it isn't necessarily to flip the moves or learn the dance mirrored.
Tested and developed on Firefox desktop.
